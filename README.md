Infinity Hurdle Racer 0.1
This is a simple game I made using pygame in python.

To open the game you must have the pygame library installed.
To run the game, first go to the folder using the cd command in the terminal. Then use the python main.py to run the game.
Make sure you install pygame (you can use pip install pygame in terminal)
