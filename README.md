# Infinity Hurdle Racer
This is a simple game I made using pygame in python.

## About Game:
It is a hurdle game which gets faster and faster as you play on. It's sort of like the google no-internet T-Rex game.

## How to run:
To open the game you must have the pygame library installed.
To run the game, first go to the folder using the cd command in the terminal. Then use the python main.py to run the game.
Make sure you install pygame first (you can use pip install pygame in terminal)
